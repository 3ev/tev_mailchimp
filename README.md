##Overview

This extension allows you to subscribe FE Users to Mailchimp Lists. Information
is kept in sync using the [Mailchimp REST API](http://kb.mailchimp.com/api/) and
[webhooks](https://apidocs.mailchimp.com/webhooks/).

The following functionality is included:

* A CLI command to download all Mailchimp lists from your account to the local
database
* BE save hooks to ensure that whenever a user is created or updated in the backend
their List subscription preferences are downloaded from Mailchimp
* Extbase slots to ensure that whever a user is created or updated on the frontend
their List subscription preferences are downloaded from Mailchimp
* Webhook listeners to ensure that whenever a user's List subscription preferences
are updated in Mailchimp they are updated in the local database
* Services to easily trigger Mailchimp subscribe or unsubscribe requests anywhere
in your code

##Installation

```
$ composer require "3ev/tev_mailchimp"
```

##Setup and Configuration

Install the extension via the Extension Manager as normal. After the extension
is installed, you should access its settings and set your [Mailchimp API key](http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/management/about-api-keys).

Using the Constants Editor, you should then set the 'TEV_MAILCHIMP -> Storage Folder'
constant, most likely on your root page template. This is the folder that all
Mailchimp lists and subscriptions are stored in.

Finally, clear your TYPO3 caches and your extension will be ready to use.

###Webhooks

If you want your site to listen to [incoming webhooks from Mailchimp](https://apidocs.mailchimp.com/webhooks/)
(which will help to keep your local list data in sync), you can setup a page
and add its URL to your Mailchimp config.

To setup a page that can listen to webhooks:

* Create a page somewhere in your page tree. This page should not be linked to
anywhere on your site
* Add an Extension Template to it, with the following Typoscript in its setup field:

    ```
    page < tev_mailchimp_webhook_json
    ```
* Add the new page's URL to the webhook config for each Mailchimp list you want
to listen to

Then just clear your TYPO3 caches, and you'll be ready to go.

###Changing the email field

By default, the extension uses the `email` field on FE Users to sync email
preferences. You can change this by setting the 'FE User email field' in the
extension configuration. This should be the lower cased, underscored field name
as it is in the database. You may want to do this if, for example, your users
use an email address as their `username`, and you don't use the `email field.

###Changing the logfile path

By default, extension logs will be written to `typo3temp/logs/mailchimp.log`. If
you'd like to change this, simply set the 'Logfile path' in the extension
configuration. This path should either be absolute or relative to the directory
that contains your `typo3/` source folder. You can set it to be outside of that
directory if you use a `../` prefix.

You can of course completely change the logging functionality using the
[core TYPO3 API](https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/ApiOverview/Logging/Configuration/Index.html)
and setting your own logging config in an `ext_localconf.php` under the
`Tev\TevMailchimp` namespace.

##Usage

TODO

###Logging

The following events are logged in the system:

* Successful and failed webhook handlers
* Successful and failed list downloads via the CLI
* Any Mailchimp API errors

See [above](#changing the logfile path) for information on changing the logging
setup.
